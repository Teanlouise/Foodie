\section{Introduction}
In the domain of discovering, deciding where to dine out is an important topic that impacts almost everyoneâ€™s lives, and most of the time it is time-consuming and frustrating. Based on research, at least once per week, everyone wants to try somewhere new from lots of different options to have a shared experience with others. However the problem arises with the gap between what users want and need, and how they are supported in fulfilling these. 

There are 8 factors that are important to almost every user when deciding where to dine out. A user wants to be able to choose what they are craving from a nearby location with easy access to basic information. These factors are all beautifully handled by existing applications, however they focus heavily on reviews when research shows that word-of-mouth recommendations have a greater influence. Additionally, those with dietary requirements (about 20\%) and those with a budget (almost everyone) must search using niche apps or be directed to a menu that they must filter themselves. What results is an average of 15 minutes searching every single time, with budget, dietary requirements and friend recommendations ignored [24].

This report details the process and feedback of three iterations of the interaction design process to design an application to support all of the factors that are important to a user when deciding where to dine out.

\section{Summary (Release 2)}
In summary, there have been three iterations of the interaction design cycle. The outcome of these cycles have been compiled and summarised for reference of progression. User research should be done at all stages so this is no way a complete list [46]. The final conceptual design (metaphors, system requirements, design principles, UX Goals) from these cycles can be viewed in \hyperref[sec:D.1]{Appendix D.1}. The progression of the prototype interface can be viewed in \hyperref[sec:D.2]{Appendix D.2}. Each iteration is denoted by a different colour; \textcolor{mygreen}{low}, \textcolor{myblue}{medium} and \textcolor{myorange}{high}. 

For release two, the next step would be to use these compilations to complete another iteration cycle. This would include updating the conceptual design (metaphors, system requirements, design principles), UX goals and prototype. Without going into full detail of these changes, the new metaphors to be introduced would be related to a refresh/reload action as well as repurposing the cross metaphor as the cancel option when checking user's navigation. A new design guideline would be introduced 'minimal effort' to ensure user's don't have issues with the selectability (particularly of dropdowns) again. There are a few system requirements that were previously mentioned by users and research that were beyond the scope of release one. These include the ability to follow other users, save lists for future self use or or for others to view, and a voting system with the comparison list.

In order of severity ratings as outlined in the high fidelity evaluation analysis, these are ideas for changes that could be applied to the next prototype iteration only focusing on what can be improved with the conceptual design from release one. 
\smallskip
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
        \item The whole box of a dropdown needs to be made selectable. $\dashrightarrow$ Fitts Law
        \item The text of options in the dropdown should be selectable. $\dashrightarrow$ Fitts Law
        \item Once an option has been selected in a dropdown users should not to worry about how they exit the overlay and should be saved no matter their next click. $\dashrightarrow$ Fitts Law
        \item Remove the edit action icon on the compare page. Instead a delete option, using the bin metaphor, will be added to the existing list of actions in the overlay when selecting an option on this page. This reduces the number of steps from 4 to 2 and replicates the same behaviour as the saved page. $\dashrightarrow$ Consistency
        \item Prompt user to save defaults if they haven't selected before exiting page.
        \item Support the display of more information when selecting the recommendations/reviews on restaurant page i.e. which friends voted.
        \item Remove the home button from the main page.
        \item Have a reset option as an icon the main page (less obvious than the GO button as it is less used) and when select prompt the user to confirm they want to reset.
        \item Add favourite action icon to overlay on history page.
        \item Add accelerator to favourite and compare buttons, long press to be directed straight there.

% CONCLUSION
\section{Conclusion}
The foundation of this application came to fruition through the initial research (both desk and interviews) performed during the development of the mind map. From this research, \textit{foodie} has been developed and refined through three iterations of the design process. Each step involved the creation/modification of the conceptual design which in turn was applied to the prototype and then tested through various evaluation methods (both user and expert based). In each iteration the gap between the gulf of execution and evaluation continued to close, mental models were better aligned, consistency throughout the system achieved, UX goals met and cognitive overload reduced using various techniques and theory. Overall, while there are still improvements to be made to release two, as briefly mentioned, the project started with identifying an issue and ended with a useable and accepted application. Users can now happily make better decision of where to dine out with less frustration and time.
