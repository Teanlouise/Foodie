\section{Introduction}
In the domain of discovering, deciding where to dine out is an important topic that impacts almost everyoneâ€™s lives, and most of the time it is time-consuming and frustrating. At least once per week, everyone wants to try somewhere new from lots of different options to have a shared experience with others. However the problem arises with the gap between what users want and need, and how they are supported in fulfilling these. 

From research and interviews, there are 8 factors that are important to almost every user when deciding where to dine out. A user wants to be able to choose what they are craving from a nearby location with easy access to basic information. These factors are all beautifully handled by existing applications, however they focus heavily on reviews when research shows that word-of-mouth recommendations have a greater influence. Additionally, those with dietary requirements (about 20\%) and those with a budget (almost everyone) must search using niche apps or be directed to a menu that they must filter themselves. What results is an average of 15 minutes searching every single time, with budget, dietary requirements and friend recommendations ignored.

This report details the process and feedback of three iterations of the interaction decision process to design an application to support all of the factors that are important to a user when deciding where to dine out.
